                <p class="open-sans-regular sub-paragraph">Located at the heart of Central Visayas, the Island province of Bohol is the 10th largest island in the Philippines with a total land area of 4,117.3 square kilometres. It is composed of an oval-shaped mainland surrounded by 72 smaller islands.

                    A popular tourist destination, the province is abundant of beaches and resorts. Its well-known beaches are found in Panglao Island, which is situated south-west of the province, and in Anda, located on the island’s east side. Bohol is composed of 1 city and 47 municipalities.
                    
                    Tagbilaran City, the capital of Bohol, is known as the “City of Friendship.” Situated in the south-western part of the province, it has a total land area of 32.70 km2 (12.63 sq mi) and a coastline of 13 km (8.1 mi). The city shares its boundaries with the municipalities of Cortes, Corella, and Baclayon. It is 630 km (390 mi) southeast of the national capital of Manila and 72 km (45 mi) south of the regional capital, Cebu City.
                    
                    Tagbilaran City’s name is derived from “Tagu Bilaan” which means TAGU (to hide) and BILAAN (a Muslim marauder tribe) – hence its name means to hide from Muslim marauders.</p>

                <p class="open-sans-regular sub-paragraph">Tarsier, (family Tarsiidae), any of about 13 species of small leaping primates found only on various islands of Southeast Asia, including the Philippines. Tarsiers are intermediate in form between lemurs and monkeys, measuring only about 9–16 cm (3.5–6 inches) long, excluding a tail of about twice that length. Tarsiers are lemurlike in being nocturnal and having a well-developed sense of smell. However, like monkeys, apes, and humans, they have a nose that is dry and hair-covered, not moist and bald as is that of lemurs. The eyes and placenta are also simiiform in structure.


                    tarsier (Tarsius)
                    Enormous eyes and padded digits are adaptations that evolved in the tarsier (Tarsius), a nocturnal arboreal primate of the rainforests of Southeast Asia.
                    
                    tarsier
                    The tarsier’s small brain has an enormous visual cortex to process information from the large goggling eyes, the animal’s most striking feature. The size of the eyes and visual cortex is probably made necessary by the absence of a reflective layer (tapetum) that the eyes of most other nocturnal mammals possess. The tarsier is also unusual in having especially long ankle bones (tarsals, hence the name tarsier), a short body, and a round head that can be rotated 180°. The face is short, with large, membranous ears that are almost constantly in motion. The fur is thick, silky, and coloured gray to dark brown. The tail is scaly on the underside like a rat’s; in most species it has an edging or terminal brush of hair.</p>

                <p class="open-sans-regular sub-paragraph">Flying lemur, (family Cynocephalidae), either of the two species of primitive gliding mammals classified in the family Cynocephalidae and found only in Southeast Asia and on some of the Philippine Islands. Flying lemurs resemble large flying squirrels, as they are arboreal climbers and gliders that have webbed feet with claws. However, the form of the head and the animals’ nocturnal habit recall those of the lemurs—hence their name. The long limbs and the tail are connected by broad folds of skin, as in bats. When a flying lemur leaps from high in the trees, the limbs are outstretched, and the animal’s controlled glide can cover 70 metres (230 feet) while losing little altitude.


                    Malayan colugo; Sunda colugo; Malayan flying lemur; Sunda flying lemur
                    Malayan, or Sunda, colugo, also called Malayan, or Sunda, flying lemur (Galeopterus variegatus). This mammal is found in Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia and southward along the Malay Peninsula to the islands of Sumatra, Borneo, and Java.
                    The Philippine flying lemur (Cynocephalus volans) inhabits several of the southerly islands in the Philippines, including Bohol, Samar, and Mindanao. The Malayan, or Sunda, colugo, also called Malayan, or Sunda, flying lemur (Galeopterus variegatus), ranges from Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia and southward along the Malay Peninsula to the islands of Sumatra, Borneo, and Java. Adults of both species can grow as large as 42 cm (16.5 inches) in body length, with a tail that extends an additional one-half to two-thirds of the body length, and they can weigh as much as 2 kg (4.4 pounds).</p>
