            The pursuit of biodiversity conservation should not remain in the hands of the academic institutions but rather share this mission with the locals and guests alike. Hence, the creation of BAHANDi. The Biodiversity, Agriculture and Heritage of Anda, Bohol, located in Anda, Bohol is a profitable, non-government enterprise that aims to promote the ecotourism of the terrestrial places in Anda, Bohol while sustaining the economy of the municipality of Anda.
            Nestled in the heart of Visayas, Bohol is an enchanting island in the heart of the Philippines. Its sprawling landscape is a tapestry of breathtaking natural wonders, from pristine coastlines to lush, verdant hills. This tropical paradise is renowned for its vibrant biodiversity and iconic attractions, offering travelers an immersive experience in ecotourism.
            Bohol has been at the forefront of guided ecotourism, allowing visitors to marvel at the country’s extraordinary wildlife and diverse ecosystems. The municipality of Anda stands out as an emerging destination for these immersive experiences, inviting travelers to explore the island’s natural splendor up close and in its natural state.
            While Bohol's ecotourism efforts have been celebrated, it is saddening to learn that the island's wildlife safari and agriculture remain largely overlooked in its tourism promotions. The untapped potential of the wildlife and agricultural experiences deserves to be highlighted and celebrated, promising unforgettable encounters with the island's rich and diverse animal inhabitants, and savory dishes and delectable desserts. Promoting and showcasing this hidden gem would not only enrich the tourism landscape of Bohol but also create awareness and appreciation for its remarkable offerings.
